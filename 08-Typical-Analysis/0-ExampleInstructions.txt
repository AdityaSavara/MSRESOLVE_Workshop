In this example an Ethane pulse is fed into a reactor.
A reference file has already been made along with uncertainties. We want to see if there is any Ethyne or Ethene in the pulse.

For now (May2020), this example Analysis is run by running the MSRESOLVE.py file in this directory, or the runfile. In the future, it will probably require using the runfile.

The collected file uncertainties are set to be taken from a point radius of 2. This small point radius was chosen because the pulse has relatively sharp changes in concentration.
As can be seen, there is no 'detectable' Ethene or Ethyne since what is observed is within the error bars.
